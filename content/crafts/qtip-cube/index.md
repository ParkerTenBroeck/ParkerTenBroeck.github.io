As promised here is the cube.

You might wonder how to construct such an object yourself. 

What ended up working for me was laying out a bottom row of QTips with a width just slightly longer than the length of the QTips' shaft.

Continue alternating the direction in which you align the QTips until you have stacked enough layers to be slightly higher than the length of the QTips' shaft.

It is very important that the grid is aligned well at this point, as you will begin inserting QTips downward through each opening in the formed grid.

I started with the 4 outer corners, then filled the outer edges, then filled the center. 

If all goes well, you will have a lovely cube which is fairly sturdy.
