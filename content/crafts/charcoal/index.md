So, for no apparent reason, I one day decided it would be interesting to start seeing what different organic objects would look like charcoalized. Here is a collection of ones which turned out interesting.

I think the garlic was my favourite of all. Though the structure did not hold up well at all, the cloves inside developed this iridescent colour akin to an oil spill or oxidation on metals
