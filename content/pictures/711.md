description = "The back of 7-11 lit up from behind the camera by a high-pressure sodium vapour lamp. To the left, a faded sign says **CARBON DIOXIDE filling station** with two metal barrels below. In the center of the frame, white graffiti saying 'Haiii :3' is seen alongside an area which has been cleaned, presumably of previous graffiti. "
